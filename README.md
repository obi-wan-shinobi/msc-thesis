# Master Thesis Project

Welcome to your master thesis project! This document outlines the key steps, resources, and recommendations to help you successfully complete your project.

---

## Getting Started

### Supervision Meetings
Regular meetings with your daily supervisors are essential for staying on track. Aim for weekly or bi-weekly meetings. [Schedule a meeting with Alexander Heinlein](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/8c40d346703344f2bbeb0132b51295f1@tudelft.nl?anonymous&ep=plink). For each meeting:
- **Prepare an agenda**: Outline the topics you want to discuss.
- **Prepare slides**: Summarize your progress and key points.
- **Follow up**: Share brief meeting minutes and outline next steps.

## Timeline

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Register the project in MaRe.
- [ ] Upload the DCO to MaRe.
- [ ] Prepare and upload the project description in MaRe.

### Interim Thesis
- [ ] Conduct a literature study.
- [ ] Set up the software environment and begin preliminary implementation and experiments.
- [ ] Formulate research questions.
- [ ] Write the interim thesis and submit it for feedback.
- [ ] Send the interim thesis to all supervisors as well as the committee members before the interim thesis presentation.

*The interim thesis and presentation should be completed after roughly 2-3 months of starting the project.*

### Interim Presentation
- [ ] Find all committee members (at least one external to the Numerical Analysis group).
- [ ] Schedule the presentation and invite all committee members (attendance by daily supervisors is mandatory; others are optional).
- [ ] Prepare the presentation.

### Research
- [ ] Perform research based on the formulated research questions.
    - *Note*: Research questions serve as a guideline. During the research process, it may become necessary to adapt or refine them based on new findings or challenges.
- [ ] Continuously document your progress, including experiments, results, and challenges.
- [ ] Regularly discuss your findings with your supervisors to ensure alignment with the project goals.

### Final Thesis
- [ ] Write the thesis, ensuring it adheres to the structure and guidelines provided in this document.
- [ ] Finalize the thesis after incorporating feedback from supervisors.
- [ ] Send the thesis to committee members for feedback (at least 2 weeks before the defense).

### Defense
- [ ] Schedule a green light meeting (minimum 6 weeks before the defense).
    - **Green light**: Daily supervisors agree the thesis is ready for defense, except for minor adjustments.
- [ ] Prepare for the defense presentation.
- [ ] Attend the defense and respond to questions from the committee.

*The total duration of the project is flexible and depends on the intensity with which the student works on the project.*

## General Tips
- **Continuously collect literature** throughout the project.
- **Write regularly** to avoid last-minute stress.
- **Review the grading rubric** to ensure alignment with evaluation criteria.
- **Access to Resources**: Arrange access to data and/or computing resources early. For instance, familiarize yourself with compute clusters if you plan to use them.
- **Make a Timeline**: Create (at least roughly) a timeline for your thesis project. Since research is not always plannable, update it as needed during the project. Keeping track of your progress is essential.

## General Remarks on Thesis Writing

### Writing Style
- **Clarity and Precision**: Be concise, precise, and mathematically rigorous. Quality is more important than quantity.
- **Figures and Tables**: Ensure all labels and legends are readable (font size similar to the main text, not less than half as large). Captions should make figures and tables self-explanatory.
- **Equations**: Number only those equations referenced later in the text.
- **Abbreviations**: Introduce abbreviations once and use them consistently.
- **Computational Results**: Mention software packages (with versions) and hardware used. Acknowledge computing resources like Delft Blue if applicable.
- **Understandability**: Write at a level of detail understandable to your peers.

### Referencing
- Reference every source you use. Justify statements or cite relevant work. If a section is based on a reference, mention it at the beginning. Incorporate references grammatically into sentences.

### Relevant Results
- Include only results used in your discussion. Move other results to an appendix if necessary.

### AI Disclosure
- If you use AI tools for writing, disclose this in your thesis.
