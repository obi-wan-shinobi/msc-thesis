# Requirements for NTK experiments (CPU)
# Tested combo chosen to avoid jax.linear_util issues and keep Neural Tangents stax working.
# Python 3.9â€“3.11 recommended.
flax==0.10.6
jax==0.5.1
neural_tangents==0.6.5
matplotlib>=3.7
tqdm>=4.66

# Notes:
# - For GPU installs, follow JAX's official instructions to pick the correct CUDA wheels.
# - If you later upgrade JAX beyond 0.5.x, Neural Tangents (archived) may break.
