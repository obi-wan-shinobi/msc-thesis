# Final Thesis

- Add the final version of your thesis (in PDF format) to this directory.
- If available, include the source files (e.g., LaTeX or Word documents) to allow for future revisions or reference.
- Ensure the file is clearly named (e.g., `final_thesis.pdf`) for easy identification.

## Writing the Final Thesis
- **Incorporate Feedback Early**: Make sure to incorporate the feedback from the interim thesis as soon as possible after you receive it.
- **Build on the Interim Thesis**: Use the interim thesis as a starting point for writing the final thesis.
- **Review Previous Theses**: It is advisable to review previous final theses for structure, style, and content. See, for instance:
  - [Examples from Kees Vuik](https://diamhomes.ewi.tudelft.nl/~kvuik/afstudeer_eng.html)
  - [Examples from Alexander Heinlein](https://searhein.github.io/master_thesis_projects/)

## Structure of the Final Thesis

The **final thesis** builds upon the **interim thesis** and includes the following chapters:

1. **Introduction/Motivation**: Provide a clear introduction to the topic and explain the motivation behind your research.
2. **Literature Review**: Offer a high-level context for your work, referencing relevant studies and explaining their relation to your thesis.
3. **Methodology**: Describe the methods you are using or plan to use in your research. Focus on describing what you use in your thesis; related works should go in the literature overview.
4. **Research Questions**: Clearly formulate the research questions that guide your work. Include one overall research question and approximately four subquestions.

In addition to these chapters from the interim thesis, the **final thesis** will include the following expanded or new sections:

5. **(Expanded) Methodology**: Provide more details on the methodology, including any refinements or adjustments made since the interim thesis.
6. **Implementation Details**: Include detailed descriptions of the implementation, where applicable.
7. **Numerical Results and Discussion**: Present detailed numerical results and ensure a thorough discussion of the results. The discussion is as important as the results themselves.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key findings, their implications, and potential future work.
