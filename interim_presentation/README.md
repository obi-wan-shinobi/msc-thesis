# Interim Presentation

- Add the slides from your interim presentation (preferably in **PDF format**) to this directory.
- If available, include the source files (e.g., **PowerPoint** or **LaTeX** files) for future reference or updates.
- Ensure the files are well-organized and clearly named (e.g., `interim_presentation.pdf`) for easy identification.

## Tips for the Interim Presentation
- The main goal is to **motivate your research questions** and **gather feedback** on your presentation.
- Prepare for a **30-minute presentation** and deliver it as if it were your final defense. This will help supervisors and committee members provide meaningful feedback on both the content and delivery.
- Focus on clarity, structure, and engaging your audience to ensure your research questions and objectives are well understood.
