# Interim Thesis

- Add your interim thesis (in PDF format) to this directory.
- If available, include the source files (e.g., LaTeX or Word documents) to allow for future revisions or reference.
- Ensure the file is clearly named (e.g., `interim_thesis.pdf`) for easy identification.

## Writing the Interim Thesis

The interim thesis is a critical milestone in your project. It serves as an intermediate step towards the final thesis and provides an opportunity for valuable formative feedback. Below are detailed instructions and recommendations:

### Structure
Include the following sections in your interim thesis:

- **Introduction/Motivation**: Provide a clear introduction to the topic and explain the motivation behind your research.
- **Literature Review**: Offer a high-level context for your work, referencing relevant studies and explaining their relation to your thesis.
- **Methodology**: Describe the methods you are using or plan to use in your research. Focus on describing what you use in your thesis; related works should go in the literature overview.
- **Preliminary Results**: Present any initial findings or results from your work so far.
- **Research Questions**: Clearly formulate the research questions that guide your work. Include one overall research question and approximately four subquestions.

### Recommendations
- **Focus on Reusability**: Ensure that all content in the interim thesis can be reused in the final thesis.
- **Seek Feedback**: Use the interim thesis as a tool to receive constructive feedback from supervisors and committee members.
- **Balance Detail and Progress**: Reflect your progress in the methodology and preliminary results sections without overextending.
- **Motivate Research Questions**: Use state-of-the-art literature and preliminary results to justify and motivate your research questions.
- **Be Focused and Concise**: Write a focused and concise manuscript, concentrating on the core aspects of your thesis.
- **Review Previous Theses**: For inspiration and guidance, review previous interim theses, such as:
